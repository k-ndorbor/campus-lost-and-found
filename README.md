# Campus Lost & Found System

## Project Description
The Campus Lost & Found System is a digital platform aimed at solving the persistent issue of misplaced personal belongings within university campuses. It allows students, staff, and other campus stakeholders to report, search for, and recover lost items efficiently through a mobile or web application. The platform fosters trust, reduces stress, and enhances security across campus.

## Target Users
- **Students:** Primary users who frequently misplace personal items.
- **Campus Security:** Verify and assist in item recovery.
- **Cleaning/Maintenance Crew:** Frequently find items during their duties.
- **Administrative Staff:** Provide oversight and integration with campus systems.

   cd campus-lost-and-found
Data Gathering Summary: Campus Lost & Found System
1. Introduction
This summary outlines both the primary and secondary data collection e4orts
undertaken to validate the need for a digital Campus Lost & Found System. These
e4orts support our understanding of user needs, existing pain points, and the viability of
the proposed solution.
2. Primary Data Collection
a) Methodologies Used
• Surveys: Distributed online to students and campus sta4
• Interviews: Conducted with security personnel and administrative sta4
• Field Observations: Informal tracking of lost item reports across campus
boards and social media groups
b) Participants
• Total surveyed: 124 students, 15 sta4 members
• Interviews: 3 security o4icers, 2 cleaning supervisors, 1 help desk administrator
c) Key Insights
• 68% of students have lost at least one item on campus in the past year
• 52% relied on social media or asking around to recover their items
• 41% never recovered the lost item
• Sta4 members expressed interest in a system to reduce inquiries and improve
recovery time
• Security o4icers noted di4iculty in tracking returned items without duplication or
fraud
Sample Survey Questions (Appendix)
• Have you ever lost an item on campus? What was it?
• How did you try to recover it?
• Did you succeed? If yes, how long did it take?
• Would you use a mobile or web app to report or search for lost items?
3. Secondary Data Collection
a) Sources Consulted
1. Journal of Higher Education Services – Studies on student engagement and
digital services
2. Campus Safety Magazine – Reports on lost item policies in U.S. institutions
3. Government of Kenya ICT Strategy – Recommends digital infrastructure in
education
4. Market Analysis: Lost & Found Tech 2023 (TechCrunch) – Highlights emerging
startups in the lost-item recovery space
5. Facebook Groups & Reddit Forums – Observed informal peer-led lost item
recovery strategies
b) Key Findings
• Institutions globally are digitizing auxiliary services for better e4iciency
• Manual lost-and-found systems often lead to item mismanagement and
frustration
• There’s a rise in interest in geo-tagged and user-authenticated item recovery
apps
4. Summary
The combination of primary and secondary data confirms that a significant problem
exists around lost items on campus. There is a demand for a more organized, digital
approach. Both users and administrators would benefit from faster, more transparent,
and verifiable systems. The research validates the need, supports the proposed
Market Research Report: Campus Lost & Found System
1. Executive Summary
The Campus Lost & Found System aims to address the recurring issue of misplaced
personal belongings within university campuses. Despite the high number of lost items
such as phones, ID cards, and keys, most institutions lack a centralized and digital
approach to manage these incidents. Our solution proposes a mobile and web
application enabling users to report, search, and recover lost or found items eDectively.
Through market research, user feedback, and analysis of existing alternatives, this
project reveals a significant opportunity to reduce stress, improve security, and foster
community trust within campus environments.
2. Problem Definition
Currently, students and staD who lose personal items face a fragmented and ineDicient
recovery process. There is no structured system to report lost or found belongings,
which leads to property loss, wasted time, and stress. The existing manual processes
are uncoordinated, largely ineDective, and vary from one campus department to
another.
3. Market Size & Opportunity
At a typical university with over 10,000 students, hundreds of items are reported lost
every semester. Informal surveys and observations reveal that at least 60% of students
have lost an item on campus, with 45% of those items never recovered. Expanding this
model across other institutions creates a scalable opportunity. Universities worldwide
represent a significant market for deployment, licensing, and support services.
4. Competitor Landscape
Competitor Description Weaknesses
Facebook Campus
Pages Informal listing of lost items No verification, limited reach
FoundIt! App Lost & found app for cities &
events
Not tailored for campus
environments
University Help Desks Manual logbooks or in-person
reporting
Slow, not searchable, no
notifications
Our Advantage: Custom-built for campus users with filters, messaging, and integration
with campus staD roles like security and cleaning crews.
5. Target Users
User Persona 1: Aisha, a First-Year Student
• Frequently moves between dorms, classes, and cafeterias.
• Lost her student ID and had to wait a week to replace it.
• Wants quick recovery and secure contact with finders.
User Persona 2: Mark, a Cleaning Supervisor
• Often finds misplaced items during evening rounds.
• Has no eDicient method to report them beyond calling security.
• Wants to upload items quickly with minimal eDort.
Key Pain Points:
• Delays in finding/reporting items
• No reliable communication channel
• Lack of verification and tracking
Desired Outcomes:
• Real-time updates on found items
• Easy search and contact features
• Trust in the platform's integrity and data security
6. Regulatory & Compliance Factors
• Data Privacy: All user data must comply with local privacy laws (e.g., Kenya Data
Protection Act, GDPR if scaled).
• Security: Secure login and authentication protocols for users.
• Ethical Concerns: Verification to prevent misuse or false claims.
7. Conclusion
The Campus Lost & Found System oDers a valuable solution to a long-standing issue
faced by students and staD. By combining user-friendly interfaces, secure
communication, and stakeholder integration, the project has high potential for impact.
With scalability options and monetization paths such as ads and institutional licensing,
this system is both socially meaningful and commercially viable.
